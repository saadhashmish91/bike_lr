Building a multiple linear regression model for estimating demand of bikes

This project is to find the elements that are most important in deciding the demand of bikes. 

The approach was as follows:
1. Understanding the data
2. Handling the categorical variables (creating dummy variables) and deleting unncecessary variables
3. EDA for basic relationship understanding
4. Diving data in test and train
5. Scaling the data
6. Model building with different approaches - forward, backward and RFE
7. Finding the best model and most important features

There is a PDF file also in the folder that has answers to subjective questions.
PS: the pair plot study in the python file takes a long time to run.
